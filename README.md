#CPSC 261 Final Project 
This was a final project I completed for CPSC 261, Web Architecture and Design in Fall 2021. It was my first exposure to HTML and CSS and this repository is a culmination of everything I learned throughout the course. In the portfolio folder is a resume file, accompanied by an index and css file to use to navigate and style the file. Any feedback/advice is appreciated!
